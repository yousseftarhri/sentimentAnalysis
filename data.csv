I recently switched to the Silicone Body Scrubber for Men, and it has completely transformed my shower routine. This upgraded scrubber is fantastic in every way.Effective Cleaning: The scrubber provides a deep and thorough clean. The silicone bristles are just the right firmness to exfoliate without being harsh on the skin. I can feel the difference in how much smoother and cleaner my skin feels after each use.Richer Foam: One of the standout features is the ability to create a richer, thicker foam. I only need a small amount of body wash, and it lathers up beautifully. This makes the shower experience more luxurious and ensures even coverage.Ergonomic No-Slip Handle: The design is excellent. The ergonomic handle fits comfortably in my hand, and the no-slip grip ensures it stays secure, even when wet. This makes it easy to maneuver and reach all areas of my body without any hassle.Long-Lasting and Easy to Clean: The premium silicone material is incredibly durable. Unlike traditional loofahs, this scrubber doesn't wear out or fall apart over time. It's also very easy to clean; a quick rinse under water, and itâ€™s good as new. No more worrying about mold or bacteria buildup.Design and Comfort: The scrubber is designed with men in mind. It's sturdy, masculine, and does the job effectively. It also feels great on the skin, providing a gentle massage that helps to relax muscles and improve circulation.Overall, the Silicone Body Scrubber for Men is a game-changer. It combines effective cleaning, luxurious foam, and a user-friendly design into one perfect product. If you're looking for a long-lasting and hygienic alternative to traditional body scrubbers, this is it. Highly recommended!

This scrubby is easy to use, has a great thick grip! It also dries quick and does not leave any grime on it. One dislike is that itâ€™s hard to scrub the brown eye with it!

Handle is kinda useless, needs to have a wider head, it just slips out of your hand.

I have tried several different brands of hand soap tablets and these are by far the best on the market. Blueland tablets have a thick, soapy foam whereas other brands seem to have a thin, watery foam. I'm also very particular about fragrances (I find many products have a strong, artificial smell) so I was very pleased with the natural smelling scents that came in the variety pack. I've only used the Iris Agave and Pacific Mist scents and really like them both, but the Agave is my favorite so far. Every manual foam soap dispenser that I've ever used always breaks so I switched to a rechargeable automatic handless soap dispenser and it works perfectly with the Blueland tablets. Any type of pump that screws onto a bottle cannot be recycled and many recyclable bottles end up in landfills, so I love the fact that I'm using less waste and it's an all around well made product.

Eco-friendly, great fresh lemon scent. I am not using a Blueland dispenser but it works well - foams up very nicely. Am not experiencing any dryness. I have used other foaming hand soaps that cause dryness but so far not an issue with this.

Okay, first of all, I just have to say that the iris agave scent is beautiful and I want everything in my house to smell like that all the time.Now on to the soap. I found the tablet dissolved quickly and completely in warm tap water in about 15 minutes, so prep is super easy. I already had a glass and metal soap dispenser bottle and didn't get a new one, so the soap does not foam. (That's not a product issue, just my decision not to buy a new bottle. If the foaming feature is important to you, be sure that you have the right kind of dispenser.) It does lather up nicely once I start rubbing my hands!

I've tried all the foaming soap tablets in my efforts to reduce plastic. But my kids complain about all of them except the Blueland ones which smell great, great lather with just one pump and they clean very well. The downside is they are so expensive. $2.50 per bottle and my kids blow through them. Also, the Blueland pumps break every other year or so but I order replacements from the company. Great soap and hope it goes on sale.

I have been a bland customer ever since my mother bought me my first starter kit a few years ago. I have one soap dispenser in the kitchen, and one in the restroom. I love that it uses minimal packaging, and no plastic! Lots of wonderful sense to choose from!

I really like this soap. It comes in many different scents which are all pretty mild. If you are an eczema sufferer, like me, you can get scent-less as well (although I haven't found the scented variety bothers me). Seems like they are all hypoallergenic.You can use any (transparent or semi-transparent) foaming soap dispenser with these tablets, provided they are 10 ounce or more. Just mark the dispenser so you can tell how much 9 ounces is. If you don't mix it right it won't foam right. I finally caved and just bought their (relatively) expensive glass dispensers, which work slightly better.A tip when it comes to refilling your dispenser:  use warm water or it won't dissolve and foam up right. Also, rinse out the dispenser prior to refilling. Every once and a while, I have to clean out the dispenser pump as well. You can disassemble the pump and clean it that way, or just put plain water in the bottle and pump it all out (until it just dispenses water with no soap).Aside from these minor hassles with the dispenser, it is easy to use. They are pretty good value for your money (compared to paying for a new bottle each time) and less wasteful. I recommend buying in bulk when Blueland has sales (usually around Earth Day, Thanksgivings & Christmas). The tablets stay good a long time, provided they are kept in their individual wrappers and in a clean dry place.

As someone from who lives in Hawaii who wants to use less plastic, I'm grateful that I can buy Blueland products from Amazon.  I noticed the Blueland website notes that Amazon ships their products to Hawaii.  I enjoy using Blueland hand soap.  It's gentle on the skin, has a subtle scent unlike the strong fragrance from Bath & Body, and easy to refill.  These tablets worked well for me.  I have no complaints and will continue buying from this vendor/Amazon.

I personally prefer foaming hand soaps because I feel gel/liquid hand soaps are too powerful. A standard full pump of gel would be enough to wash my hands 10 times over and leaves me running for my lotion.A foaming hand soap is gonna be less concentrated because it's already mixed with water -> normally, I'd feel ""cheated out of value"". BUT one of these tablets is comparable in price to an equivalent bottle of gel. It lasts longer because it's impossible to ""use too much"". And you're saving on the energy + money cost of shipping the weight of water.I like the available scents, and as a hand soap, it fits me perfectly. Will buy again.

I recently purchased the Vplus 100% Compostable Paper Plates, and I have been quite pleased with their performance. These plates offer a fantastic balance between convenience and eco-friendliness. Here are the reasons why I give them a 4.5-star rating:Eco-Friendly Materials: One of the standout features of these plates is their composition. Made entirely from sugar cane fibers, they are 100% compostable and biodegradable. It feels great knowing that I'm using a product that has a minimal impact on the environment. These plates are a step in the right direction towards reducing plastic waste.Sturdy and Heavy-Duty: Despite being compostable, these plates are surprisingly durable. The heavy-duty construction allows them to hold up well to various types of food, including moist or heavier items. I haven't experienced any issues with leaking or bending, which is essential when hosting parties or BBQs.Three Compartment Design: The three compartments on each plate are a convenient feature. They help keep different food items separate, preventing flavors from mingling. It's perfect for serving meals with multiple components, such as BBQs or dinner parties. The compartments are well-sized, accommodating a decent amount of food in each section.Generous Pack Size: The 125 pack size is excellent for larger gatherings or frequent use. It offers great value for the price, ensuring that I have plenty of plates on hand for various occasions. I appreciate not having to worry about running out of plates during parties or events.Easy Disposal and Cleanup: The compostable nature of these plates makes cleanup a breeze. Once used, they can be disposed of in the compost bin without any guilt. They break down naturally over time, reducing waste and environmental impact. It's a hassle-free solution compared to traditional plastic or foam plates.My only minor drawback is that occasionally, the compartments may have a slight variation in size, but it hasn't affected the overall functionality of the plates.Overall, the Vplus 100% Compostable Paper Plates have been a great addition to my kitchen and party supplies. They are environmentally friendly, sturdy, and offer the convenience of a three-compartment design. If you're looking for an eco-conscious option for daily meals, dinner parties, or BBQs, these plates are a fantastic choice!

We host a weekly neighborhood street gathering, something that started during the pandemic and has continued.  We have neighbors who are much better chefs that we will ever be, so our contributions include setups, plus tables and awnings.  As the food contributions have gotten better and more substantial, the need for better than flat paper plates has also grown.  I also do the cleanup, and the idea of compostable plates seems better than dumping stuff that will still be recognizable in a landfill in ten years.These plates are sturdy enough to hold real food without bending/spilling, stand up nicely to plastic knives and forks we use, and look/feel elegant for our gatherings.  They meet all our expectations so far, and we'll be buying more I'm sure.  At least until I can install a dishwasher at the end of the driveway.We do recommend these plates.

These plates are great for all types of food. They look porous, but they donâ€™t leak. I like the weight of them too. There are no problems microwaving food on them.I like the fact that Iâ€™m not killing trees when I use these. After buying these, I went on here again and bought the bowls also. Iâ€™m sticking with this brand.

Ever since I was a child I liked divided plates as a fun way to serve a snack or small meal. These plates were sturdy. The divisions were just the right size. My grand children enjoy them. I will order again.
